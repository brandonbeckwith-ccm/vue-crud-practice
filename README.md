## Details

- The todo list is *scrollable* preventing the need to scroll away from the controls.
- Clicking the '+' button without a todo will take you to a dedicated page.
- Text boxes turn blue when they have valid input. 
   - Trying to submit invalid input will result in a small error popup.
- The *blue* button next to a todo will take you to an 'edit' page.
- Delete simply deletes. You click it and the todo goes 'poof'
- Sorting can be done with the dropdown.
